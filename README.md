# Task 4: Build a Version-Controlled DevOps Project with Git

This project demonstrates Git best practices using GitHub:

- Initialized a Git repository.
- Added key project files (e.g., source code, configuration).
- Set up branches:
  - `main` — production-ready base.
  - `dev` — active development branch.
  - `feature/...` — one or more feature-specific branches.
- Completed development workflows via pull requests between branches.
- Tagged important milestones (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
